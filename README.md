# CrowdsourcedGrade
This code generates elevation and grade estimates from crowdsourced GPS data based on paper: By cyclists, for cyclists: Road grade and elevation estimation from crowd-sourced fitness application data. The code describes two methods detailed in the paper (method 1 and method 2). An example is provided for Burrard Bridge in the City of Vancouver with the input files available in the Input folder and the generated estimates along with accuracy measurements in the Output folder.
