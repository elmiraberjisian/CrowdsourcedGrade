# CrowdsourcedGrade
This code generates elevation and grade estimates from crowdsourced GPS data based on paper: By cyclists, for cyclists: Road grade and elevation estimation from crowd-sourced fitness application data. The code describes two methods detailed in the paper (method 1 and method 2). An example is provided for Burrard Bridge in the City of Vancouver, with the input files available in the Input folder and the generated estimates along with accuracy measurements in the Output folder.
Please install the packages indicated in the first section of the code to avoid any errors.
I am not a programmer so the code might not be as efficient as you would like to (my apologies), all collaboration to make the code smoother is highly appreciated.
